**Take control of your digital focus. Block distractions. Build discipline.**

## 📌 What is FocusGuardian?

FocusGuardian is a productivity tool for Windows that helps users stay focused by:
- Blocking distracting apps like **Chrome**, **Reddit** etc
- Preventing their access even if reopened during a focus session
- Tracking **total focus hours**
- Logging every **blocked attempt** with a timestamp

It's designed for students, developers, or anyone who wants to reclaim their time.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer        | Tech                         |
|--------------|------------------------------|
| **Frontend** | React.js + TailwindCSS       |
| **Backend**  | Node.js + Express + MongoDB  |
| **Agent**    | Node.js (running locally)    |

---

## ⚙️ How it Works

1. **Login/Signup** via the React frontend.
2. On login, the token is securely sent to the **Agent**, which monitors running apps.
3. User selects a **timer duration** (e.g., 25 mins) and starts a **Focus Session**.
4. During the session:
   - Agent checks every few seconds for blocked apps.
   - If found, it **forcefully kills** the app and logs the attempt.
5. Stats like **total focus time** and **blocked attempts** are shown in real time.
